# This quote bot is retiring

**The `addquote` command will stop working on December 1, 2016.**

**The entire system will go offline on December 31, 2016.**

I built this bot in an afternoon for a single channel. From the very beginning,
I did not put any effort into making the code that powers it good, because I
intended it to be used by one or two people every one in a while.

Then I forgot about the existence of that code.

Now the bot is used by close to one hundred streamers and more than one thousand
quotes have been added to the database. While I am flattered that this project
has received so much attention, here's the problem: The code is abslutely
atrocious and the database requires some manual work, because removing quotes is
not possible.

When I first wrote this bot, I was not aware of any project with similar
functionality, which is why I hacked the thing together in the first place. I
considered continuing the work on this bot to make it more usable, but I don't
really have the time to do that and fortunately, there is now another project
which should more or less work as a drop-in replacement to my code.

See https://community.nightdev.com/t/customapi-quote-system/7871.
I have not tested this bot, but it seems to do everything my bot does, but a lot
better.

You can use http://joules.himmel-villmar.de/list.php?s=STREAMER to get a list of
the quotes which are currently in the system so that you can manually transfer
them over. Replace `STREAMER` with the streamer's name.

I apologize for the inconvenciences caused by this but in the long run this
really is the best solution.
